# refnxtoolbox

A repo for tools and code snippets peripheral to Andrew Nelson's refnx (https://github.com/refnx/refnx).



## AreaDistributionModel
A refnx-type model that allows for incoherrent averaging of one structural variable

## AreaDistributionTools
Bits and pieces that aid in working with distribution models.

## FreeformVFP.py
The original location of the bestest interfacial-volume constraining freeform model (now included in the main renfx repo).

## rednhelpers
Bits and pieces that aid in reducing reflectometry data in refnx. Mostly written by Stuart Prescott (llimeht).

## areaSlab.py
An interfacial-volume constraining slab model. Currently a bit of a mess because of refnx's relentless development.

## plottools.py
For pretty-plotting reflectometry data and associated models created in refnx.

## savemagics.py
For saving objectives as python scripts from ipython notebooks and enhancing compatibility with HPC workflows. Currently a bit of a mess because of refnx's relentless development.
